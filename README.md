# tennis_data_project
This project presents a comprehensive and detailed analysis of tennis match data, focusing not only on uncovering player demographics, international representation, competition structures, and scheduling trends, but also on the critical processes of data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Given the complexity and volume of raw data, significant effort has been dedicated to preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and ensuring data quality, which form the foundation for reliable analysis. Utilizing advanced statistical methods and rich visualization techniques, the study systematically explores underlying patterns and relationships within the dataset. This approach enables a deeper understanding of the competitive landscape in professional tennis, providing actionable insights into player performance, country participation, match scheduling, and overall dynamics of the sport.
