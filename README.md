# tennis_data_project
This project presents a comprehensive and detailed analysis of tennis match data, focusing on uncovering player demographics, international representation, competition structures, and scheduling trends. After rigorous data cleaning and high-precision exploratory data analysis—including handling missing or inconsistent values, normalizing data formats, and validating entries—the study delves into multiple facets of the sport. Player demographics such as age, height, and ranking distributions are thoroughly examined to identify meaningful patterns and trends. International participation is analyzed by exploring the diversity and frequency of countries represented in tournaments over time. The dynamics of competition are investigated through match outcomes, rivalry patterns, and progression stages within tournaments. Additionally, scheduling trends are scrutinized to understand match durations, timings, and their potential impacts on player performance. Through a combination of statistical techniques and advanced visualizations, this analysis aims to provide deep insights into the professional tennis landscape, supporting enhanced understanding and strategic decision-making in the sport.
